---:Steps to Run The Project:---

Download the whole project from Google Classroom.
Extract the zip file and navigate to the folder which contains all the downloaded data of the zip file.
Now select the file repository.
Follow up to the src folder over where run the Main.java folder acting as the hub containing all major imports in it.

:---Description of the Logic used to develop the project:--- The MainGame file is a simple framework for a game inspired by the mechanics of Angry Birds, implemented in Java. At its core, the `MainGame` class serves as the main controller, managing different game states such as loading, playing, and settings. It initializes essential components like the game load page, settings, and play functionality through the `class_initiate` method. The game updates and renders graphics based on the current state, leveraging a game loop that aims for approximately 60 frames per second. The `Pannel` class is used for drawing graphics and handling user input, with keyboard controls managed by the `Keyinns` class. Overall, this structure provides a foundation for a graphical game with a focus on managing different gameplay aspects and user interactions.
